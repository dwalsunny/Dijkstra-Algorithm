# Dijkstra-Algorithm

Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++

How to build/use:

  1.  You must include the class as: #include "Dijkstra_Algorithm.h"
  2.  The class Graph is delcared as: Graph_Dijkstra* graph = new Graph_Dijkstra();
  3.  The interface (members and methods) can be seen in the Graph.h header file.
  4.  You must compile your program with the gnu c++ 11 compiler:
          g++ -std=c++11 your_program.cpp
  5.  main.cpp has an example on how to use Dijkstra's graph algortihm
